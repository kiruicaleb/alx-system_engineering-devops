DNS resolution: Your computer sends a DNS request to a DNS server to resolve the domain name "www.google.com" into an IP address.

Establishing connection: Your computer establishes a TCP connection with the server's IP address on the appropriate port.

Encrypted traffic: The connection is secured using HTTPS, ensuring that the traffic between your browser and the server is encrypted.

Firewall: The encrypted traffic passes through your computer's firewall, which checks for any security concerns and ensures that the communication meets the defined rules.

Load balancer: If Google uses a load balancer, it distributes the request to an appropriate web server to achieve optimal resource utilization and availability.

Web server: The web server receives the request and serves the corresponding web page to fulfill the request.

Application server: For more complex web applications, an application server may generate the web page by processing logic and business processes.

Database interaction: If the application server requires data from a database, it sends a request to the database server to retrieve or update the necessary information.
