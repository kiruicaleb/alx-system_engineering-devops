Key detection: The keyboard hardware detects the physical press of the "g" key and sends a corresponding electrical signal to the computer.

Keyboard driver: The operating system receives the electrical signal from the keyboard and passes it to the keyboard driver. The keyboard driver translates the signal into a specific key code or character representation.

Input event: The keyboard driver generates an input event for the "g" key press, indicating that the "g" key has been pressed.

Application focus: If there is an active application or window on the computer, the operating system directs the input event to that specific application, allowing it to receive the key press event.

Text input: If the application has a text input field in focus (e.g., a document editor or a text box), the input event triggers the insertion of the character "g" at the cursor position within the text field.

Command execution: In certain applications or contexts, the "g" key might be associated with a specific command or function. For example, in web browsers, pressing "g" often focuses the browser's address bar, allowing the user to initiate a search or enter a URL.
