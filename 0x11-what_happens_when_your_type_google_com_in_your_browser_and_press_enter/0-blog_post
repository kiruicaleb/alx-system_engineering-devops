When you type "https://www.google.com" in your browser and press Enter, several processes are set in motion. Firstly, your computer sends a DNS request to a DNS server to translate the domain name "www.google.com" into an IP address. Once the IP address is obtained, a TCP connection is established between your computer and the server at that IP address to facilitate reliable communication. Before the connection proceeds, it passes through your computer's firewall, which checks for any security concerns based on predefined rules. Since you entered "https://www.google.com," the browser uses the HTTPS protocol to establish a secure connection, ensuring encrypted communication between your browser and the server using SSL or TLS. In the case of large-scale websites like Google, a load balancer distributes incoming requests across multiple servers for optimal resource utilization and availability. The load balancer then routes your request to an appropriate web server that can handle it. The web server receives your request, processes it, and generates a response, while more complex web applications may involve an application server to handle logic and business processes. If necessary, the application server communicates with a database server to retrieve or update relevant data. Once the processing is complete, the response flows back through the same chain in reverse order, finally reaching your browser. Your browser renders the received data, allowing you to interact with the Google search page displayed on your screen. It's important to note that while this overview provides a general understanding, the specific technical implementation may vary for different websites.
